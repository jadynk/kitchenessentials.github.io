	<h1>Let's get to know your enemy</h1>
	<p> To begin, as with any difficult boss, you must know what they are capable of. This guy is capable of a lot.
	Let's begin with the basics of this fight. First the boss himself and the arena:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The Fume Knight has 10,100 health in a new game and 14,140 health in NG+ after that his health will increase about 25%-50% each playthrough</li>
		<li>He has two forms:
			<ol>
				<li>His first form. He wields one quick hitting Fume Sword, and his much larger, and slower Fume Ultra Greatsword.</li>
				<li>His 0% fun mode. At around 50%-60% health he will drop his small sword and light the Ultra Greatsword on fire. Dark magic fire.
			</ol>
		<li>He can deal a very minuscule amount of fire damage when his sword glows in his first form, and he deals a huge chunk of both dark and fire damage in his second form.</li>
		<li>As a DLC boss, he takes the regular 15% general elemental damage reduction for bosses and another still unknown damage reduction against attacks dealing only one type of elemental 
		damage</li>
		<li>His elemental resistance goes from most to least defence as follows: Fire > Lightning > Magic/Dark</li>
		<li>He immune to the red eye rings effects.</li>
		<li>There are four Ashen Idols outside his boss room, they will heal him making the battle even more difficult unless you destroy them.</li>
		<li>You can summon two NPC's for this fight, however neither is worth their tiny health and minuscule damage consdiering the defence and health
		he gains from each being present</li>
		<li> Lastly if you hear Velstadt's helm (his brothers helm) into battle he will go into his second form first thing.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> To properly prepare for this fight you must be prepared for both of his forms, and that his moveset actually completely changes halfway through,
	meaning you must memorize two of them. Great.</p>

	<p> His first form is the less threatening of the two, but still extremely difficult to deal with. Dual wielding a straight sword and a much larger greatsword, 
	he attacks quickly and brutally. Here is a summary of most of his moves in this form:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li>His most common distance attack is a running stab with his small sword, it is pretty basic but can be a pain if you're trying to heal</li>
		<li>His most common attack altogether is a quick 2-3 hit combo, again from his small sword. This will take a lot of stamina to block and is fairly hard to dodge. 
		It is often followed by one of several other attacks from his greatsword.</li>
		<li>He has two horizontal slashes and one overhead slash from his greatsword. All are fairly predictable but deal heavy damage. They are usually used at a medium range 
		to follow his straight sword attacks. The overhead smash will make his greatsword glow giving it a very small amount of fire damage.</li>
		<li>He will occasionally block with his greatsword for a while seemingly at random, attacking will cause him to counter-attack with his small sword and healing will also 
		cause him to attack</li>
		<li>Lastly he has a swing to his side with each sword that is quick and damaging and designed to punish circling. 
		These attacks are painful and annoying but he takes a moment more to recover from them.</li>
	</ul>
