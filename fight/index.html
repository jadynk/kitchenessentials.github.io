	<h1>Let's get to know your enemy</h1>
	<p> To begin, as with any difficult boss, you must know what they are capable of. This guy is capable of a lot.
	Let's begin with the basics of this fight. First the boss himself:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The Fume Knight has 10,100 health in a new game and 14,140 health in NG+ after that his health will increase about 25%-50% each playthrough</li>
		<li>He can deal a very minuscule amount of fire damage when his sword glows in his first form, and he deals a huge chunk of both dark and fire damage in his second form.</li>
		<li>As a DLC boss, he takes the 15% general elemental damage reduction being a boss and another still unknown damage reduction against attacks dealing only one type of elemental 
		damage</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<ol>
		<li>His first form. He wields one quick hitting Fume Sword, and his much larger, and slower Fume Ultra Greatsword.</li>
		<li>His 0% fun mode. At around 50%-60% health he will drop his small sword and light the Ultra Greatsword on fire. Dark magic fire.
	</ol>
	
	<p> To properly prepare for this fight you must be prepared for his second form, and that his moveset actually completely changes, meaning you must memorize two of them. Great.
