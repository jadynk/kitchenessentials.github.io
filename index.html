	<h1>Having some trouble with that pesky Fume knight?</a></h1>
	<p>Well maybe I can help. One of the most infamously difficult bosses in the infamously difficult game, Dark Souls 2. Many struggle with this duel wielding demon, 
	he boasts a complex moveset that is both unpredictable and punishing and his massive health and defence make the fight drag on for ages. An intimidating fight to be sure,
	it seems nearly impossible to create an effect strategy for defeating him. This is partly true, however the Dark Souls community has, on countless forums and wikis, has
	put together a library of techniques to help players through their fist fight. This site is a synthesis of those strategies, and I hope it helps those who are having trouble
	on this monster of a fight</p>

	<h2>Also a video:</h2>
	<p>For those of you who aren't fans of the written guides, here is a relatively comprehensive video on the fight. Its not as in depth but you get a feel of his moveset<p/>
