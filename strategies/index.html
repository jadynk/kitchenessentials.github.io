	<h1>Here are some sweet strats!</a></h1>
	<p>The easiest way to get through this fight quickly, as with any boss, is to develop a plan and play-test it to perfection. While it is always best to make your own 
	strategy personalized to your playstyle, the techniques listed here should act as a useful reference and place to start.</p>

	<h2> First decide your general playstyle:</h2>
	<h3> Melee </h3>

	<p>For melee builds this fight will be long and treacherous. Staying within striking range means you must put yourself in danger, and mistakes will be costly. However,
	there are a few techniques to help you survive:
	<ul>
		<li>Tank builds will usually do very poorly against this bosses split damage types and endless combos, so consider altering your build to focus on dodging, or 
		if you must stick with blocking, resistance boosting rings and armour, as well as a solid greatshield are vital. I would recommend the Gyrm sheild or Havel's shield.</li>
		<li>Weapons that require less stamina to use are usually preferable to maintain the constant dodging while still doing damage. This makes powerstancing's high risk high reward
		nature even more obvious.</li>
		<li>Due to the weird damage calculators used for the DLC bosses, infused weapons are a very good way of improving your damage output, however you aren't likely to get a chance to reapply 
		the effect, so use it well!</li>
		<li>Try to stay behind him. While he has attacks to punish circling it is still less dangerous to stand behind him and wait for his slower attacks for an opening.</li>
		<li>Healing spells and resistance spells, especially the Denial miracle, can give you much more breathing room, and improve your chances.</li>
		<li>Really a general tip is to just be patient.Only try to hit once or twice at a time. Even with maximum AR this fight will last a while, making you more likely to take impatient risks and get punished for it</li>
