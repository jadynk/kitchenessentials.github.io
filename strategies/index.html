	<h1>Here are some sweet strats!</a></h1>
	<p>The easiest way to get through this fight quickly, as with any boss, is to develop a plan and play-test it to perfection. While it is always best to make your own 
	strategy personalized to your playstyle, the techniques listed here should act as a useful reference and place to start.</p>

	<h2> First decide your general playstyle:</h2>
	<h3> Melee </h3>

	<p>For melee builds this fight will be long and treacherous. Staying within striking range means you must put yourself in danger, and mistakes will be costly. However,
	there are a few techniques to help you survive:
	<ul>
		<li>Tank builds will usually do very poorly against this boss's split damage types and endless combos. Consider altering your build to focus on dodging, or 
		if you must stick with blocking, resistance boosting rings and armour, as well as a solid greatshield are vital. I would recommend the Gyrm sheild or Havel's shield for their elemental defence.</li>
		<li>Weapons that require less stamina to use are usually preferable to maintain the constant dodging while still doing damage. This makes powerstancing's high risk high reward
		nature even more obvious.</li>
		<li>Due to the weird damage calculators used for the DLC bosses, infused weapons are a very good way of improving your damage output, however you aren't likely to get a chance to reapply 
		the effect, so use it well!</li>
		<li>Try to stay behind him. While he has attacks to punish circling it is still less dangerous to stand behind him and wait for his slower attacks for an opening.</li>
		<li>Healing spells and resistance spells, especially the Denial miracle, can give you much more breathing room, and improve your chances.</li>
		<li>Really a general tip is to just be patient.Only try to hit once or twice at a time. Even with maximum AR this fight will last a while, making you more likely to take impatient risks and get punished for it</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Caster</h3>

	<p>For casters of any type, this fight will be about timing and tenacity. Casters will generally have lower defence, making mistakes more costly, but staying out of his range makes the fight generally safer.
	However it will not be easy by any means, folowing the steps below may help you reduce the challenge somewhat:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As a Caster, the main danger of this fight may actually be his smaller sword in the beginning, as it is very quick and hard to get away from. Make sure to anticipate his faster attacks and know 
		all the warning signs of one.</li>
		<li>As for his greatsword, some practised rolling backwards and to the right will often help you keep your distance and make an opening. Don't roll to much though or his relentless attacks will catch up to you.</li>
		<li>Bring as many spell refill items and attunement slots as possible, the knight's resistance will make this fight a long one and you will need a number of them.
		This goes doubly for lightning and fire casters as they will be doing negligible damage.</li>
		<li>Focus your equipment on improving your casting time, the windows for casting will not be big and during casting is when you'll be in the most danger.</li>
		<li>Only cast one spell per opening, you will not get more in.</li>
		<li>Consider a cloranthy ring to improve you dodging, speed is the only way to win this fight.</li>
		<li>Lastly you can essentially ignore defence (unless you're a weird armoured mage) if you get hit, you're probably going to die. Instead focus on damage and speed, the quicker the fight is over the less likely you are to make a mistake.</li>
	</ul>
