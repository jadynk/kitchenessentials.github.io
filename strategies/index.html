	<h1>Here are some sweet strats!</a></h1>
	<p>The easiest way to get through this fight quickly, as with any boss, is to develop a plan and play-test it to perfection. While it is always best to make your own 
	strategy personalized to your playstyle, the techniques listed here should act as a useful reference and place to start.</p>

	<div class="title2"> Here are a few tips for each general playstyle:</div>
	<h3> Melee </h3>

	<p>For melee builds this fight will be long and treacherous. Staying within striking range means you must put yourself in danger, and mistakes will be costly. However,
	there are a few techniques to help you survive:
	<ul>
		<li>Tank builds will usually do very poorly against this boss's split damage types and endless combos. Consider altering your build to focus on dodging, or 
		if you must stick with blocking, resistance boosting rings and armour, as well as a solid greatshield are vital. I would recommend the Gyrm shield or Havel's shield for their elemental defence.</li>
		<li>Weapons that require less stamina to use are usually preferable to maintain the constant dodging while still doing damage. This makes powerstancing's high risk high reward
		nature even more obvious.</li>
		<li>Due to the weird damage calculators used for the DLC bosses, infused weapons are a very good way of improving your damage output, however you aren't likely to get a chance to reapply 
		the effect, so use it well!</li>
		<li>Try to stay behind him. While he has attacks to punish circling it is still less dangerous to stand behind him and wait for his slower attacks for an opening.</li>
		<li>Healing spells and resistance spells, especially the Denial miracle, can give you much more breathing room, and improve your chances.</li>
		<li>Really a general tip is to just be patient.Only try to hit once or twice at a time. Even with maximum AR this fight will last a while, making you more likely to take impatient risks and get punished for it</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Caster</h3>

	<p>For casters of any type, this fight will be about timing and tenacity. Casters will generally have lower defence, making mistakes more costly, but staying out of his range makes the fight generally safer.
	However it will not be easy by any means, folowing the steps below may help you reduce the challenge somewhat:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As a Caster, the main danger of this fight may actually be his smaller sword in the beginning, as it is very quick and hard to get away from. Make sure to anticipate his faster attacks and know 
		all the warning signs of one.</li>
		<li>As for his greatsword, some practised rolling backwards and to the right will often help you keep your distance and make an opening. Don't roll to much though or his relentless attacks will catch up to you.</li>
		<li>Bring as many spell refill items and attunement slots as possible, the knight's resistance will make this fight a long one and you will need a number of them.
		This goes doubly for lightning and fire casters as they will be doing negligible damage.</li>
		<li>Focus your equipment on improving your casting time, the windows for casting will not be big and during casting is when you'll be in the most danger.</li>
		<li>Only cast one spell per opening, you will not get more in.</li>
		<li>Consider a cloranthy ring to improve you dodging, speed is the only way to win this fight.</li>
		<li>Lastly you can essentially ignore defence (unless you're a weird armoured mage) if you get hit, you're probably going to die. Instead focus on damage and speed, the quicker the fight is over the less likely you are to make a mistake.</li>
	</ul> 
	<h3>Non Magic Ranged</h3>
	<img src="/pics/rangedbuild.jpg" alt="A archer squaring off against a dragon." width="450" height="300"/>
	<p>Honestly, I'm not quite sure a non magic ranged approach is at all optimal for this fight. While you'll share the advantages of the caster's approach, the damage output won't even compare. However it can be done
	and these tips may help you through your madness:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bring tonnes of high quality ammo. Dark and magic arrows and bolts will be the only way to deal any real damage. Poison and bleeding also will not work.</li>
		<li>Greatbows may seem like a good way to speed things up but be exceptionally careful their long draw time makes them almost unusable in this fight. Although it is not impossible.</li>
		<li>Follow the advice on dodging in the Caster section, dodge often, conserve stamina.</li>
		<li>If you are using crossbows then dual wield. This is actually a pretty viable strategy and powerstancing can up your damage quite a bit.</li>
		<li>If you're crazy enough to try a consumables only run then witching urns seem to work the best. Also maybe consider a new hobby like knitting.</li>
